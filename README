The first objective was to be able to construct monster and object instances by
creating factories for each. These instances use data parsed from desc files to populate some of the classes attributes, such as
rarity damage etc.. Some attributes are given as instances of a dice object and with the exception of damage a roll() function
was used to assign real values to all attributes represented as dice in the desc files. Second, objects and monsters are generated
and placed on the map using rarity values, they are also displayed in color found in there desc files. Generated instances with
uniq and art attributes are limited to a maximum of 1 each per generation. I also changed the rendering and monster generation
functions as well as adding in a object class to fulfill these goals.

NOTES:
  active desc files are located in the saved_dungeons folder of the main directory
  monsters and pc's will cover generated objects but will become visible when characters move off them.
