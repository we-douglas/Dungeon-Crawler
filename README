WIP!

Main goal of the game is to move your character (@) to the exit of each floor (<)
Controls and more details will be added soon!
 
NOTES:
  active desc files are located in the saved_dungeons folder of the main directory
  monsters and pc's will cover generated objects but will become visible when characters move off them. 
  
  
TO RUN:
  Open main project directory in terminal.
  $ make
  $./rlg327
